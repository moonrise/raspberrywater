===== main entry URL
http://localhost:8080/ which runs main.py via app.yaml URL mapper


===== the root
* app.yaml - Google App Engine (GAE) meta/URL mapper
* index.yaml - GAE indexer
* main.py - python script that shows the menu entry (the Main Entry for the whole project)


===== top level folders:
* app
this is more like "static" folder with html, javascripts, css, images, etc...

* lib
javascript library folder
the idea was to hold all js libraries here, but it did not work out like that.
the actual *.js, *.css stuff needed to be at the root of the static assets (the app folder).
so it holds the big libraries as references including non runtime materials

* sandbox
the testing ground

* templates
html templates, but not being used at the moment

* waterapp
this is the main entry for the water app and the place for the python scripts (the server)
all other assets are served from app folder (client really)
