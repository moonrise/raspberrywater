        <h3>Hydroid</h3>
        Hydroid is a device built on Raspberry PI that is capable of watering plants
        and reporting the plant status via still photos along with environment variables like
        ambient temperature and soil moisture. The user interface to hydroid is built
        with mobility in mind over cloud infrastructure provided by Google Application
        server. Unexpectedly from the initial intent, the scheduling feature turned out
        to be handsomely suitable for remote time lapse photo series as well. Here is a video
        clip that shows the watering in action.

        <h4>System Overview</h4>
        Hydroid system is made of three major components with HTTP as the communication link betwen them:
        <ul>
        <li>hydroid hardware built on Raspberry PI</li>
        <li>client applications on mobile device browsers</li>
        <li>server application on Google Application Engine</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>features - hardware</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>solenoid control to dispense water drops</li>
        <li>manual button in the circuit board to release one drop</li>
        <li>blinking LED for the system running status</li>
        <li>ambient temperature read</li>
        <li>soil moisture read between 0% and 100%</li>
        <li>MCP3800 AD converter supports up to 8 channels of analog inputs</li>
        <li>camera for static photos</li>
        <li>the system automatically recovers on network failure and system restarts</li>
        <li>the system is implemented with python 2.7 with a few additional modules imported to support HTTP/Json and imaging support</li>
        <li>wireless network support</li>
        </ul>

        <image src="/doc/images/hydroid-circuit.png" style="margin: 10px"/>

        <h4>features - client</h4>
        The client application is accessed from any browsers by pointing to “http://waterthem.appspot.com/index.html”. The application is written in HTML5/JavaScript/CSS to service wide variety of platforms. It is optimally designed and tested for Android and IPhone devices. It should work on any devices that jQueryMobile is supported. A photo taken from hydroid system is shown below with the timestamp on the top left.
        <ul>
        <li>on demand hydroid heart-beat along with the temperature and soil moisture</li>
        <li>on demand photo (320x240) request with a click of a button</li>
        <li>on demand or scheduled watering task</li>
        <li>active tasks reports in the active tasks panel</li>
        <li>most recent N number of historical jobs in the history panel</li>
        <li>one minute refresh button for each press</li>
        <li>a series of photos can be played with 0.25 second interval</li>
        <li>cancel support for scheduled tasks</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>features - server</h4>
        Server component is built on Google Application Engine with Python runtime.
        <ul>
        <li>highly scalable and reliable application service framework</li>
        <li>free with daily data usage quota; pay as you go if you reach the quota</li>
        <li>the server code can be re-deployed anytime without service interruption</li>
        <li>the server admin, runtime statistics are readily available from GAE admin utilities</li>
        <li>Google’s datastore is used for data storage (not SQL like) and to support the synchronization of multiple requests from clients and hydroid devices</li>
        <li>photo data is separately managed by blob store with image url service</li>
        <li>HTTP/JSON based API set is provided for the clients and hydroid units</li>
        <li>task state management: pending, waiting, running, canceled, bumped, timed out, finished</li>
        <li>certain client requests are coalesced not to flood the system</li>
        <li>change state management so that large payloads are transferred only when needed</li>
        <li>designed to handle multiple hydroid units</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>postmortem</h4>
        The system works as intended. Improvements can be made in a number of areas.
        <ul>
        <li>The entire system is based on HTTP protocol. The responsiveness of the communication between three major components is a challenge with periodic polling. Long poll (comet) can solve this problem in most areas, but this solution or similar was not implemented because Google App Engine framework does not support the long held connections. There could be some workaround to achieve similar results.</li>
        <li>Visual feedback of the hydroid sites can be enhanced with video streaming. This solution turned out to be a challenge with Google App Engine because it does not support streaming (HTTP multipart post) in general. Video uploading and playback can be a workaround solution even though it may not be real time feedback.</li>
        <li>It will be nice to have the available water level reported with warnings if it reaches below certain threshold. Currently, the photo taken can give you some idea how much water remains. Further the confirmation of the water delivery can be explicitly noted if we can measure the water flow or computer vision is deployed to analyze the photo taken at the time of water delivery.</li>
        </ul>
